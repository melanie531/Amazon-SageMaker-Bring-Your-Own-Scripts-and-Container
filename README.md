# Amazon SageMaker Bring Your Own Scripts and Container

This git repo was developed based on the git repository [Amazon SageMaker Local Mode Examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-local-mode), which shows different examples of running SageMaker Training and Serving in local instance/machine.

In this git repo, we added examples of running the SageMaker Training and Hosting jobs on SageMaker Notebook Instances using **local** mode with some commonly used frameworks, e.g. Scikit Learn, XGBoost, and etc.
